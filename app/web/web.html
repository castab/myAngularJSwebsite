                            <h3>The Beginnings</h3>
                            <p>My very first experience with any kind of web development came from tinkering around with the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13678" target="_blank">ESP8266 WiFi-enabled microcontroller</a>.  Before I knew what APIs were (much less, write an API), my default interface with the microcontroller was a very simple website that included a simple dialog and a drop-down box that would turn one of its IO pins HIGH or LOW; triggering an attached relay.</p>
                            <p>Fast-forwarding to a crazy summer, I stumbled upon Lynda.com and found a beginner's course on PHP!  By the end of the summer, I was enthralled with what could be done with a little bit of server-side processing and some persistant storage such as SQL.</p>
                            <p>Over time, I picked up a good chunk of HTML and CSS, but I would have to say that my biggest leap was my internship with Target.  Throughout my internship, I picked up AngularJS and I couldn't believe how far behind I was with respect to data/session binding.  To drive this further, AngularJS isn't even one of the most recent frameworks!</p>

            <md-card-content layout-padding>
            <md-content>
                <p>I made a small demo showcasing some of the <i>newer</i> skills I gained over the past year or so.</p>
                <p>Using a mix of AngularJS, PHP, and MySQL, I've created a dynamic page from which data is fetched from an SQL server and wrapped into a JSON payload by PHP and then shot here for display.</p>

                <p>I've always wondered how some websites just make their websites look <i>just so <b>outstandingly</b> good!</i>  All I needed was a little push to see that it really is some heavy CSS'ing with JavaScript handling the reigns.</p>

                <p>During my internship at Target, I picked up a lot of the skills used on this website now!  A big part of it was AngularJS and the use of modules, controllers, services, and how they can manipulate to the DOM.</p>
                <p>Before picking up AngularJS, I used a combination of vanilla Javascript and W3's CSS framework (W3CSS) that made up the old version of this website.  You can visit it <a href="./old" >here</a> but keep in mind that it is outdated and buggy.</p>
