                    <p>Interestingly enough, the vision for this project came to me during a gathering with some of my colleagues.  I remember watching the various decorations and colors...  It occurred to me that I could use a MOSFET to control the current flow of a higher voltage source using a low voltage PWM signal.  The idea was just too good to let go from my mind so I scribbled notes on one of the napkins!</p><p>Thankfully enough, a group of us got together and discussed the idea as I was scribbling out the rough draft of what would become a working circuit.</p>

                    <p>The concept of addressable LEDs was still a brand new idea that became cheap enough to reach consumers.  Shortly after my involvement with the <a href="#!/wildwest">Wild West Shootout Game</a>, I just couldn't get enough of these things and thought to myself, what if the same idea was applied to 10-, 30-, 50-, or even 100-watt LEDs?  So, using a little circuit know-how, I prototyped a controllable 50-watt RGB LED.</p>
